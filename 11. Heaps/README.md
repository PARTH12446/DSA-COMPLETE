# Heaps

- **Topic**: Heaps / Priority Queue
- **Goal**: Learn min-heap & max-heap usage, and solve k-th element / top-k / merge problems.

## Subtopics

- Implementing min-heap / max-heap (using Java `PriorityQueue`)
- Kth smallest / largest
- Top K frequent elements
- Merge K sorted arrays / lists
- Heap vs sorting trade-offs

## How to Use This Folder

- Pick a problem from the Striver sheet for the Heaps section.
- Try it yourself on the original platform first.
- Then open the corresponding `.java` file here and compare approaches.
- Add notes or comments in the code when you learn a new trick.

## Progress

- [ ] Basic heap operations
- [ ] K-th element problems
- [ ] Top-K / frequency problems
- [ ] Merge problems
- [ ] Revision round
