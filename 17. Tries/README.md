# Tries

- **Topic**: Trie (Prefix Tree)
- **Goal**: Handle prefix-based queries efficiently (insert/search words, count prefixes, etc.).

## Subtopics

- Basic Trie implementation
- Insert / search / delete word
- Count words equal to / starting with a prefix
- Longest word with all prefixes present
- Bitwise trie (if included in problems)

## How to Use This Folder

- Map each file to the corresponding problem in the Striver sheet.
- Before checking the solution, implement the trie problem on your own.
- Use this code to revise common patterns (node structure, children array/map, counts).

## Progress

- [ ] Basic Trie operations
- [ ] Prefix count problems
- [ ] Longest word / prefix problems
- [ ] Bitwise trie (if any)
- [ ] Revision round
