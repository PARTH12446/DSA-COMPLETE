# Strings (Advanced)

- **Topic**: Advanced string algorithms & patterns
- **Goal**: Handle complex string problems efficiently (patterns, hashing, advanced sliding window, etc.).

## Subtopics

- Advanced sliding window on strings
- String hashing (if used)
- Pattern matching ideas
- Palindromic strings / substrings
- Any special tricks used in this section

## How to Use This Folder

- Use this folder after finishing the basic `05. Strings` section.
- For each problem:
  - Try to solve it from the sheet/platform.
  - Then compare with the implementation here.
  - Note down any new pattern (e.g., window + hashmap, two pointers, hashing).

## Progress

- [ ] Sliding window (advanced)
- [ ] Hashing-based problems
- [ ] Palindromic problems
- [ ] Mixed pattern/string problems
- [ ] Revision round
