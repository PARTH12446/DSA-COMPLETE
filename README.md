## Striver DSA Complete – Java Solutions

This project contains my **complete Java solutions** for Striver's A2Z DSA roadmap.

It is organized exactly by topic (Arrays, Binary Search, Sliding Window, Trees, DP, etc.) so that I can:

- **Practice DSA in a structured way**
- **Revise concepts quickly** before interviews
- **Track progress** topic‑wise and day‑wise

If you are following the same sheet, you can use this project as a reference and a personal practice log.

## About the Project

Striver's **A2Z DSA Course / Sheet** is a complete roadmap to learn Data Structures and Algorithms from basics to advanced.

This project contains:

- **Topic‑wise Java implementations** of the problems from the sheet
- Clean, readable code focused on **clarity over shortcuts**
- A structure that matches the **A2Z topic order** (Basics → Sorting → Arrays → Binary Search → … → DP)

The main goal is to have a **single place** where I can code, revise, and track my Striver A2Z DSA preparation.

## Folder Structure

Each topic is organized in its own folder. Inside each topic, there are subfolders/files for individual problems.

> Click on a folder below to explore the code:

1. [Learn The Basics](./01.%20LearnTheBasics)
2. [Sorting](./02.%20Sorting)
3. [Arrays](./03.%20Arrays)
4. [Binary Search](./04.%20BinarySearch)
5. [Strings](./05.%20Strings)
6. [Linked List](./06.%20LinkedList)
7. [Recursion](./07.%20Recursion)
8. [Bit Manipulation](./08.%20BitManipulation)
9. [Stack & Queue](./09.%20Stack%26Queue)
10. [Sliding Window](./10.%20SlidingWindow)
11. [Heaps](./11.%20Heaps)
12. [Greedy](./12.%20Greedy)
13. [Binary Trees](./13.%20BinaryTrees)
14. [Binary Search Tree](./14.%20BinarySearchTree)
15. [Graphs](./15.%20Graphs)
16. [Dynamic Programming](./16.%20DynamicProgramming)
17. [Tries](./17.%20Tries)
18. [Strings (Advanced)](./18.%20Strings)

Each of these folders may have its own small `README.md` with more details about that topic and the problems inside.

## How to Run the Code

### Prerequisites

- **Java JDK** installed (any recent version is fine, e.g. 8+)
- A Java‑friendly IDE or editor, such as IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code with Java extensions, or Eclipse

### Option 1: Run from IDE (recommended)

1. **Open the project folder** `Striver-DSA-Complete` in your IDE.
2. Navigate to the topic folder (for example `10. SlidingWindow`).
3. Open the problem file, such as `MaximumPointsFromCards.java`.
4. Make sure the file has a `main` method or a test harness.
5. Use the IDE **Run** button to execute the file.

### Option 2: Run from terminal

From the project root:

1. Go to the folder containing the Java file you want to run.
2. Compile:

   ```bash
   javac MaximumPointsFromCards.java
   ```

3. Run:

   ```bash
   java MaximumPointsFromCards
   ```

Change the class name in the commands according to the file you want to execute.

## How to Study with this Repo

- **Follow the topic order** from the A2Z sheet and open the matching folder here.
- For each problem:
  - Try to **solve it yourself first** on the original platform (LeetCode, Coding Ninjas, etc.).
  - Then compare your approach with the solution in this repo.
  - Add comments or alternative approaches if you learn something better later.
- Use this repo as a **revision tool**:
  - Before interviews or contests, quickly revisit important topics (Arrays, Binary Search, Sliding Window, Trees, Graphs, DP).
  - Re‑run and tweak solutions to refresh logic.

If you are following a **30‑day plan**, you can map each day’s topics directly to these folders and mark which files/problems you have completed.

Happy coding and all the best for your DSA and interview prep!
